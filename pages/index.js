      <p>
        There are three subjects we&apos;ll cover this week, each with one or
        two courses. Each course will have a Glitch project that you can Remix
        so that you can follow along.
      </p>
      <p>
        We&apos;ll start with Redux! There&apos;s only one Redux course;
        we&apos;re going to dive right in by building our own Redux
        implementation from scratch.
