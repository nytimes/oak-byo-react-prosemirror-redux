# Review: ProseMirror Basics

Let's start our overview of ProseMirror by comparing it to the other
technologies we've gone over so far. In many ways, ProseMirror is an
"all-in-one" library which handles the roles of both Redux and React, but it's
specifically crafted around one use case: rich text editing.

## State management

Like Redux, ProseMirror has a store singleton that's responsible for maintaining
and updating an immutable state object, and provides an API for dispatching
actions that describe state updates. In ProseMirror, the singleton is called the
"editor view" (as the name implies, it also does a lot more than state
management, which we'll get to later).

Unlike Redux, which allows users to manage state with a completely arbitrary
shape by defining custom reducers, ProseMirror has a specific state class called
the "editor state". Similarly, ProseMirror has the notion of a "transaction",
which is roughly analogous to an action in Redux. However, while in Redux,
application code is responsible for defining and dispatching actions, the vast
majority of transactions in ProseMirror are constructed by ProseMirror itself,
in response to a user interacting with the browser!

Just like `store.getState()`, `view.state` returns a snapshot of the current
state object. `view.dispatch()` is similar to `store.dispatch()`; it takes a
transaction and uses it to produce a new editor state. It's also possible to
"subscribe" to changes to the editor view, but the interface is different from
Redux: instead of a `subscribe()` method, ProseMirror relies on the notion of
plugins to execute side effects and update the view when the state changes.

### Customizing state management

While ProseMirror doesn't let users fully customize the shape of the state it
manages, its plugin architecture does support storing _additional_ state. In
fact, we could reimplement the state for our Redux toy application entirely with
ProseMirror:

<CH.Code>

```javascript index.js
const { EditorState, Plugin } = require("prosemirror-state");
const { EditorView } = require("prosemirror-view");
const { schema } = require("prosemirror-schema-basic");

const counterPlugin = new Plugin({
  state: {
    init: () => 0,
    apply(transaction, state) {
      const counterPluginMeta = transaction.getMeta(this);
      switch (counterPluginMeta?.type) {
        case "counter/incremented":
          return state + 1;
        case "counter/decremented":
          return state - 1;
        default:
          return state;
      }
    },
  },
});

const view = new EditorView(document.getElementById("editor"), {
  state: EditorState.create({ schema, plugins: [counterPlugin] }),
});
```

</CH.Code>

We'll add the view later!

ProseMirror also allows the user to _configure_ the primary editor state object,
by specifying a "schema" for the document. The editor view will take the schema
into consideration when applying transactions, ensuring that the resulting
editor state has a valid document according to the schema.

Lastly, ProseMirror supports customizing the editor view's `dispatch` function,
just like middleware in Redux, by passing a `dispatchTransaction` prop when the
editor view instance is created. We can, for example, implement a logging
middleware just like we did in our Redux example:

<CH.Code>

```javascript index.js
const view = new EditorView({
  state,
  dispatchTransaction: (transaction) => {
    console.log("will dispatch", transaction);

    const newState = view.state.apply(transaction);
    view.updateState(newState);

    console.log("state after dispatch", view.state);
  },
});
```

</CH.Code>

## View management

Like React, ProseMirror maintains a tree of elements (in ProseMirror these are
called "nodes"), and it performs some synchronization after each update cycle to
ensure that the DOM matches the node tree. In part because ProseMirror manages
both the state _and_ the view in an application, there's a tighter coupling
between the two. The node tree is actually directly stored in state, as
`view.state.doc`.

In order to determine how to actually render a given node as an HTML element,
ProseMirror first inspects on what it calls a "node spec". A node spec is not
dissimilar from a React component; it specifies what props a node takes
(ProseMirror calls these "attributes"), what type of children it allows
(ProseMirror calls this "content"), and how it should be represented in the DOM
(via `toDOM`).

If you squint a little, `toDOM` even looks somewhat like JSX. Here's a
comparison:

```jsx
function Paragraph(props) {
  const { id, children } = props;
  return <p id={id}>{children}</p>;
}

Paragraph.propTypes = {
  id: PropTypes.string,
};

Paragraph.defaultProps = {
  id: "",
};
```

```javascript
const paragraphSpec = {
  content: "text*",
  attrs: {
    id: { default: "" },
  },
  toDOM: (node) => {
    const { id } = node.attrs;
    return ["p", { id }, 0];
  },
};
```

Note: ProseMirror uses the number zero (which it refers to as "hole") to
indicate where to place a nodes children. This is roughly analogous to the
`children` prop in React.

Notably, there is no notion of effects or lifecycle for these node specs; by
default, state is entirely managed by ProseMirror, and effects are entirely
managed through plugins.

ProseMirror also supports more complex views for nodes, which it calls "node
views". Node views have similar flexibility to full fledged React components.
They don't get to make use of ProseMirror's convenient `toDOM` shorthand;
instead, they are able to take full control over managing their own DOM
elements. This ends up looking like reimplementing some of the React internals
that we worked on in our React section.

The above paragraph node might be implemented like this as a node view:

```javascript
function paragraphNodeViewCreator(node) {
  const dom = document.createElement("p");
  if (node.attrs.id) {
    dom.id = node.attrs.id;
  }
  return {
    dom,
    contentDom: dom,
    update: (node) => {
      if (node.type === "paragraph") {
        dom.id = node.attrs.id;
        return true;
      }
      return false;
    },
  };
}
```

### Non-node views

ProseMirror plugins also support managing arbitrary DOM. With this behavior, we
can actually fully implement our counter from the Redux example:

<CH.Code>

```javascript index.js
const { EditorState, Plugin } = require("prosemirror-state");
const { EditorView } = require("prosemirror-view");
const { schema } = require("prosemirror-schema-basic");

const counterPlugin = new Plugin({
  state: {
    init: () => 0,
    apply(transaction, state) {
      const counterPluginMeta = transaction.getMeta(counterPlugin);
      switch (counterPluginMeta?.type) {
        case "counter/incremented":
          return state + 1;
        case "counter/decremented":
          return state - 1;
        default:
          return state;
      }
    },
  },
  view: (view) => {
    const countElement = document.getElementById("count");
    // counterPlugin.getState() is like a plugin-specific state selector!
    const count = counterPlugin.getState(view.state);
    countElement.innerHTML = count.toString();

    document.getElementById("increment").addEventListener("click", () => {
      const transaction = view.state.tr;
      transaction.setMeta(counterPlugin.key, { type: "counter/incremented" });
      view.dispatch(transaction);
    });

    document.getElementById("decrement").addEventListener("click", () => {
      const transaction = view.state.tr;
      transaction.setMeta(counterPlugin.key, { type: "counter/decremented" });
      view.dispatch(transaction);
    });

    return {
      update: (view, previousState) => {
        const count = counterPlugin.getState(view.state);
        countElement.innerHTML = count.toString();
      },
    };
  },
});

window.view = new EditorView(document.querySelector("#editor"), {
  state: EditorState.create({
    schema,
    plugins: [counterPlugin],
  }),
});
```
