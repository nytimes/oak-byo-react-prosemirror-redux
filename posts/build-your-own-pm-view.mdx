# Buld your own ProseMirror view

Let's build a view layer for ProseMirror from scratch! We won't build support
for everything that ProseMirror provides with its official view library, but it
will provide a taste of what is involved.

## Introduction

We'll start with a simple ProseMirror sample that uses the standard schema. Our
implementation won't support marks or decorations, and it won't support custom
views, but it will demonstrate how to build the core components of a ProseMirror
view library. Our implementation will also be made simple by not supporting all
of the browsers that ProseMirror supports.

<CH.Code>

```javascript index.js
const { EditorState } = require("prosemirror-state");
const { schema } = require("prosemirror-schema-basic");

const doc = schema.node("doc", null, [
  schema.node("paragraph", null, [schema.text("Hello, ProseMirror!")]),
  schema.node("paragraph", null, [schema.text("Time to edit!")]),
]);

window.view = new EditorView(document.querySelector("#editor"), {
  state: EditorState.create({ doc }),
});
```

    <div id="editor" style="margin-bottom: 23px"></div>
    <script src="/index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

</CH.Code>

## Getting started

This editor is really basic. It doesn't include ProseMirror's `keymap` plugin,
so it's not even possible to add new paragraphs. That's okay. We're going to
build our own `EditorView`. It won't support ProseMirror view plugins, but we'll
use modern browser input events and implement sensible defaults.

Comment out the line to require `EditorView`, create the file `editor-view.js`
and add it to the `index.html` file. We'll build out this `EditorView` step by
step until it works!

<CH.Code>

```javascript editor-view.js
class EditorView {
  constructor(dom, { state }) {
    this.dom = dom;
    this.state = state;

    this.dom.contentEditable = true;
  }
}
```

```html index.html focus=22
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>ProseMirror basic example</title>
    <meta charset="utf8" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://prosemirror.net/css/editor.css" />
    <script src="https://prosemirror.net/examples/prosemirror.js"></script>
    <script src="/require-pm.js"></script>
    <style>
      #editor {
        white-space: break-spaces;
      }

      p {
        line-height: 1.2rem;
        min-height: 1.2rem;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="editor" style="margin-bottom: 23px"></div>
    <script src="/editor-view.js"></script>
    <script src="/index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

```javascript index.js focus=1,3
/* global EditorView */
const { EditorState } = require("prosemirror-state");
// const { EditorView } = require("prosemirror-view");
const { schema } = require("prosemirror-schema-basic");

const doc = schema.node("doc", null, [
  schema.node("paragraph", null, [schema.text("Hello, ProseMirror!")]),
  schema.node("paragraph", null, [schema.text("Time to edit!")]),
]);

window.view = new EditorView(document.querySelector("#editor"), {
  state: EditorState.create({ doc }),
});
```

</CH.Code>

Our `EditorView` just stores the state and sets the `contentEditable` attribute
of the provided DOM element. Notice how this is enough for the browser to make
the content editable. The browser even lets us add paragraph breaks! There is no
standardized behavior for editable content, though. Where one browser might add
a new paragraph tag, another might add a hard break. That's why ProseMirror will
prevent you from adding a new paragraph! You have to add a `keymap` plugin that
says _exactly_ what transactions should run when you press the "return" key.

Modern browsers implement an [Input Events] standard. It defines a `beforeinput`
event and a set of input types that express common editing activities. And the
best part for us is that all of these events are cancelable. That means we can
start from a blank slate, and then start to build out the interactions we want.

[input events]: https://w3c.github.io/input-events/

<CH.Code>

```javascript editor-view.js focus=6:7,12:18
class EditorView {
  constructor(dom, { state }) {
    this.dom = dom;
    this.state = state;

    this.onBeforeInput = this.onBeforeInput.bind(this);
    this.dom.addEventListener("beforeinput", this.onBeforeInput);

    this.dom.contentEditable = true;
  }

  destroy() {
    this.dom.removeEventListener("beforeinput", this.onBeforeInput);
  }

  onBeforeInput(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
  }
}
```

</CH.Code>

We've taken a really important step! By preventing the default actions of the
browser, we'll make that the _EditorState_ the source of truth for what should
be in the DOM. The browser is no longer in control. We are!

<details>

<summary>Remind you of something?</summary>

React components create a virtual DOM, a description of what the DOM _should_
contain. React reconciles any of the differences between successive renders by
updating the real DOM to match. Your application state is the source of truth,
not the DOM. In a similar same way, `EditorState` is a description of what the
editor _should_ contain. The `EditorView` is responsible for updating the DOM.

</details>

The view will be responsible for updating the state in response to input events,
but it also needs to be responsible for updating the DOM to reflect the state.
Before we start to add interactions to our editor, let's take a detour and get
it to render the state.

## Rendering

Let's make a function to render a ProseMirror node. Our function is going to
return a DOM node representation of our ProseMirror node. For simplicity, we'll
start with text nodes.

<CH.Code>

```javascript editor-view.js focus=1:6
function renderNode(node) {
  if (node.isText) {
    return document.createTextNode(node.text);
  }
}

class EditorView {
  constructor(dom, { state }) {
    this.dom = dom;
    this.state = state;

    this.onBeforeInput = this.onBeforeInput.bind(this);
    this.dom.addEventListener("beforeinput", this.onBeforeInput);

    this.dom.contentEditable = true;
  }

  destroy() {
    this.dom.removeEventListener("beforeinput", this.onBeforeInput);
  }

  onBeforeInput(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
  }
}
```

</CH.Code>

To add support for other kinds of nodes, we need to use the `NodeSpec` for the
node to generate what ProseMirror calls a `DOMOutputSpec`. In real schemas, the
`DOMOutputSpec` can be quite complicated. The DOM representation can be made up
of a number of HTML elements, but we're going to keep things simple. For now,
let's assume every `NodeSpec` returns a very simple structure from its `toDOM`
function.

We're not trying to practice recursion here, so we'll assume that the "hole",
where ProseMirror renders the children of the node, is the content of the one
and only DOM node. With this simplifying assumption, all we need to do is look
at the first item of the array returned by `toDOM` to get the tag name.

<CH.Code>

```javascript editor-view.js focus=6:7
function renderNode(node) {
  if (node.isText) {
    return document.createTextNode(node.text);
  }

  const [tagName] = node.type.spec.toDOM(node);
  return document.createElement(tagName);
}
```

</CH.Code>

The `EditorView` is the view for the document, but we are going to need views
for all of the nodes of the model now that we can render them. Let's get that
structure in place.

<CH.Code>

```javascript editor-view.js focus=10:38,40[18:30],42,52
function renderNode(node) {
  if (node.isText) {
    return document.createTextNode(node.text);
  }

  const [tagName] = node.type.spec.toDOM(node);
  return document.createElement(tagName);
}

class View {
  constructor(dom, parent, children) {
    this.dom = dom;
    this.parent = parent;
    this.children = children;
  }

  destroy() {
    this.parent = null;

    for (const child of this.children) {
      child.destroy();
    }
  }
}

class TextView extends View {
  constructor(node, dom, parent) {
    super(dom, parent, []);
    this.node = node;
  }
}

class NodeView extends View {
  constructor(node, dom, parent) {
    super(dom, parent, []);
    this.node = node;
  }
}

class EditorView extends NodeView {
  constructor(dom, { state }) {
    super(state.doc, dom, null);
    this.state = state;

    this.onBeforeInput = this.onBeforeInput.bind(this);
    this.dom.addEventListener("beforeinput", this.onBeforeInput);

    this.dom.contentEditable = true;
  }

  destroy() {
    super.destroy();
    this.dom.removeEventListener("beforeinput", this.onBeforeInput);
  }

  onBeforeInput(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
  }
}
```

</CH.Code>

Note that the `EditorView` is just a special case of `NodeView`, where the node
is the document node.

<details>

<summary>More flashbacks?</summary>

We're building something not unlike React's fiber tree. We've got a tree that's
linked downwards and upwards, with each view having references to its parent and
its children.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Taking out the trash</summary>

When we destroy the editor view, we have to remove the DOM event listener. Why
why do we set `parent` to `null` in the base class when we destroy a view? The
JavaScript engine automatically deletes unused objects in a process known as
garbage collection. We can help ensure that it deletes our views by removing
references to them. As long as we break the `parent` reference, we've removed
one side of the reference cycle between a parent and a child, which makes it
easier for garbage collection to reason about whether the object is still in
use. Consult the Wikipedia entry for [garbage collection] for more details.

[garbage collection]:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)

</details>

These views receive their initial DOM representation as an argument to their
constructor, but they don't initially have any children. These views need to
render their children. The editor, which starts out empty, will render its
children, and they will return their children, and so on until we render the
whole document!

<CH.Code>

```javascript editor-view.js focus=5,8:24
class NodeView extends View {
  constructor(node, dom, parent) {
    super(dom, parent, []);
    this.node = node;
    this.updateChildren();
  }

  updateChildren() {
    this.node.forEach((child, offset, index) => {
      const childView = this.children[index];
      if (childView) {
        return;
      }

      const childDOM = renderNode(child);
      this.dom.appendChild(childDOM);

      if (child.isText) {
        this.children[index] = new TextView(child, dom, this);
      } else {
        this.children[index] = new NodeView(child, dom, this);
      }
    });
  }
}
```

</CH.Code>

If everything is working correctly, we should now see our paragraphs and our
text in the document!

## Updating the view

Now that we can construct an initial empty view and render all the children, we
need a way to update it when it changes. We'll leave this unimplemented in the
base class, but implement it for `TextView` and `NodeView`. The method will take
a new node, update the DOM to match, and return `true` if it is possible to do
so. If it's not possible to update the view, the method will return `false`.

We'll also need to make sure that we account for updating in `updateChildren`.
When its possible to update a child, we'll do so. Otherwise, we'll destroy it
and recreate it. We'll also need to remove any extra children.

<details>

<summary>Optimization possibilities</summary>

It may not be efficient to destroy and recreate children all the time when some
updates might be possible to perform in place. It's not possible to update the
text nodes, but if we implemented node attributes we could set the attributes of
the existing DOM node to match our new ProseMirror node. You may also note that
adding a child anywhere but at the end of a node will destroy and recreate all
the children after it. The real implementation tries to keep any children that
did not change, even when adding and removing children. We're not going to try
to handle that here, but note that this is not dissimilar from what React needs
to do and how you can use keys to tell React about the identities of individual
children.

</details>

<CH.Code>

```javascript editor-view.js focus=7:9,19:27,33:38,42:46,55:58
class TextView extends View {
  constructor(node, dom, parent) {
    super(dom, parent, []);
    this.node = node;
  }

  update() {
    return false;
  }
}

class NodeView extends View {
  constructor(node, dom, parent) {
    super(dom, parent, []);
    this.node = node;
    this.updateChildren();
  }

  update(node) {
    if (!this.node.sameMarkup(node)) {
      return false;
    }

    this.node = node;
    this.updateChildren();
    return true;
  }

  updateChildren() {
    this.node.forEach((child, offset, index) => {
      const childView = this.children[index];
      if (childView) {
        const updated = childView.update(child);
        if (updated) {
          return;
        }

        childView.destroy();
      }

      const childDOM = renderNode(child);
      if (childView) {
        this.dom.replaceChild(childDOM, childView.dom);
      } else {
        this.dom.appendChild(childDOM);
      }

      if (child.isText) {
        this.children[index] = new TextView(child, dom, this);
      } else {
        this.children[index] = new NodeView(child, dom, this);
      }
    });

    while (this.children.length > this.node.childCount) {
      this.children.pop().destroy();
      this.dom.removeChild(this.dom.lastChild);
    }
  }
}
```

</CH.Code>

## Editing

Wow! That was a lot, but we're here. We can construct an editor view and it can
render an editor state. Finally, we can get back to handling events, and making
those events update our state!

Let's add methods to our `EditorView` to dispatch a transaction and set state.
We can also handle our first input event to insert text.

<CH.Code>

``` javascript editor-view.js focus=17:25,30:36
class EditorView extends NodeView {
  constructor(dom, { state }) {
    super(state.doc, dom, null);
    this.state = state;

    this.onBeforeInput = this.onBeforeInput.bind(this);
    this.dom.addEventListener("beforeinput", this.onBeforeInput);

    this.dom.contentEditable = true;
  }

  destroy() {
    super.destroy();
    this.dom.removeEventListener("beforeinput", this.onBeforeInput);
  }

  dispatch(tr) {
    const newState = this.state.apply(tr);
    this.setState(newState);
  }

  setState(newState) {
    this.state = newState;
    this.update(this.state.doc);
  }

  onBeforeInput(event) {
    event.preventDefault();

    switch (event.inputType) {
      case "insertText": {
        const { tr } = this.state;
        tr.insertText(event.data);
        this.dispatch(tr);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</CH.Code>

What's going on!? If you've gotten this far, you should be able to type in the
editor again. But no matter where you click and type, the letters appear at the
top of the editor. We're not handling selection changes! ProseMirror thinks the
selection begins at the start of the document, and moves it forward each time we
insert text, but we're not telling it when the user sets a new selection. We'll
have to tackle that next.
